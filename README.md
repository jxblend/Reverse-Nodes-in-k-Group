# Reverse-Nodes-in-k-Group
 Linked list problem

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

Example input:

2
1 2 3 4 5 a

Output:

2 1 4 3 5
